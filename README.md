Problem Statement:-

Locked-In-Syndrome(LIS) also known as pseudocoma is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles except for vertical eye movements and blinking.



Proposed Solution:-

A vision based computer interface which detects voluntary eye-blinks and interpret them as control commands. The employed image-processing methods include Haar-like-features for automatic face detection, and template matching based eye tracking and eye-blink detection.
